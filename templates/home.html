  <p>This analysis will show how the weather changes as you get closer to the equator.</p>
  <p>The data was assembled by accessing the OpenWeatherMap API. After the 
    data was retrieved, I used matplotlib and pandas to show the various aspects of the data. 
    Humidity, temperature, cloudiness, and windspeed were compared with the latitude of the data.</p>
